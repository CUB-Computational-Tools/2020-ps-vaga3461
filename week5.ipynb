This means that for all the energy you would exert trying to push down a wall in your house, you aren't doing any work!\n",

Looking back at the kinetic energy equation, we can see that it only contains two terms, mass and velocity, and we will assume that mass remains constant in our problems. Therefore, the change in kinetic energy, or work done, is driven by a change in velocity. Again, if no displacement has occurred, then no change in velocity has occurred, and work done is zero."

If we want to use the stairwell as our reference frame, then the initial height of the ball would be 10 feet, and it could fall down the stairs to land at a final height of 0 feet. But what if those stairs start on the sixth floor of a building (that is, at 60 feet above the ground) and climb to the seventh floor (70 feet above the ground)? By casting the problem this way, we've changed our reference frame to be that of the earth, where the ground below our feet is taken to be 0. You can see how choosing a frame of reference is important in calculations of potential energy; our convention in this assignment will be to treat the ground as 0 for all problems."
