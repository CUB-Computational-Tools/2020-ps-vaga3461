    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When you jump into a swimming pool, it's a completely different experience from putting your fist through a window. This has to do with the differences in <b><i>rheology</i></b> between glass and water. <b><i>Rheology describes the way in which a material deforms in response to stress</i></b>. Glass responds to your fist by shattering in a brittle fashion, while water flows around you when you jump into the pool. In this lab we will explore different types of deformation, and will apply our new knowledge of deformation to some geologic problems."

    "### Stress and strain\n",
    "\n",
    "As suggested in the introduction, different substances respond to stress in different ways. <b><i>Stress</i></b>, denoted by $\\sigma$, is a force per unit area exerted on an object. <b><i>Strain</i></b>, $\\epsilon$, is the objects's response to stress. Strain is expressed as a unitless number describing the change that an object has undergone (e.g., lateral stretching, shearing, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics-speak, \"normal\" means \"perpendicular to a surface.\" Therefore, we call a strain that results from stress applied perpendicular to a surface the <b><i>normal strain</i></b> ($\\epsilon_N$). Normal strain may be computed by dividing the change in length by the original length. It is generally expressed as a percentage, hence why we multiply by 100 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\epsilon_N = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L} * 100$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects responding to stress can also exhibit <i><b>shear strain</b></i> ($\\gamma$), which is written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\gamma = \\tan \\beta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike normal strain, which results from stress applied perpendicular to a surface, shear strain results from stress applied parallel to a surface. This type of strain is calculated from the tangent of the angle between the original and deformed sides. Both are shown below (from Sharir et al., 2008).\n",

    "## Rheology (styles of deformation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal and shear strain broadly describe deformation as a response to applied stresses; however, these terms tell us more about the stress that was applied than about the characteristic behavior of the material undergoing deformation. To understand material behavior, we recognize three modes of deformation: elastic, brittle-plastic, and viscous/ductile."

    "### Elastic\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic materials, such as springs, rubber bands, and moon shoes, strain in proportion to the stress applied. In the case of deformation of a spring, we write Hooke's Law. This law states that the force (which is related to stress by unit area) required to displace an object some distance is equal to the length of displacement times a constant\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F = kx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is the change in length of the object undergoing deformation and $k$ is the spring constant. Can you work out the units of $k$? Now think carefully about what this equation tells us about material behavior. We can see that if the force applied is 0, displacement must also be 0. This is the defining characteristic of elastic objects: they regain their original shape when the force applied is removed. This lab will focus on elastic deformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hooke's Law can be written in a more general form as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma = E\\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E$ is a factor called Young's modulus, and $\\sigma$ and $\\epsilon$ have been defined above as stress and strain, respectively."

    "### Brittle-plastic deformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many materials fall into the plastic rheology class. These materials can withstand a finite amount of stress for which they will experience minimal strain. However, when stress exceeds the material's strength, they will begin to deform permanently (and often rapidly). If the deformation is discontinuous (meaning the material physically shatters), such as the crust fracturing in a geologic fault zone, we say it is <b><i>brittle-plastic</i></b> deformation. If deformation is continuous, permanent, and requires crossing a stress threshold to occur, then we say it is <i><b>plastic, or ductile</b></i>. Can you think of an example of ductile deformation?\n",

    "### Linear viscous\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear viscous materials (linear viscous fluids) undergo continuous and permanent deformation. This means that unlike plastic materials, there is no strength threshold that needs to be exceeded for deformation to occur. And unlike elastic materials, linear viscous fluids do not \"bounce back\" from an applied stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the example of jumping into a pool of water. The fact that the water reshapes to a flat surface after you jump into the pool does not mean that the deformation has been undone, just that the process of deformation involved water moving until its new surface was flat. If we could see the individual water molecules, we would see that the structure of the fluid is irreversibly changed every time it deforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss viscous rheologies more in the next lab. For now, you should know that linear viscous fluids exhibit a linear relationship between stress and strain rate, multiplied by the fluid's dynamic viscosity. We typically expresses linear viscous deformation in terms of the shear component of stress and the shear strain rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau = \\mu \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau$ is shear stress, $\\mu$ is dynamic viscosity, and $\\frac{d\\gamma}{dt}$ is shear strain rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we think explore rheology throughout today's lab, ask yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why are elastic and plastic rheologies expressed in terms of strain, and linear viscous rheology is in terms of strain rate?\n",
    "- Why do we only care about the shear component in linear viscous deformation?\n",
    "- Does this makes sense to you? Why or why not?\n",

    "Imagine you wanted to conduct an experiment to investigate elastic behavior. You could do this very simply using household items, such as a rubber band and an assortment of coins (in this example, we'll just use pennies.) By suspending known quantities of pennies from the rubber band, we cause a downward directed force which results in displacement (stretching) of the band. By tracking both the weight suspended and the resultant displacement, we can make a plot that will reveal whether or not our rubber band obeys linear elastic behavior, i.e. Hooke's Law. \n",

    "\n",
    "3. Imagine you tested the same set of weights as used in the example on a different spring. The amount of extension experienced by the new spring was triple the extension in the original spring for each weight. Please manipulate the already created displacement_array_m to reflect this change. Then, please make a plot with both lines appearing on the same graph (HINT: a lot of coding is searching the internet for an example where someone else has already tackled a similar problem. In this case, a quick Google of \"how to put two lines on one graph matplotlib\" will help if you're stuck). You're plot should include axis labels, titles, etc, just like the example. Finally, summarize the plot in one or two sentences, relating the lines that you've graphed to Hooke's Law. What does this tell you about the materials?\n",
