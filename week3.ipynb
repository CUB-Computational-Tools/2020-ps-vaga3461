    "If you cast your mind back to your first chemistry class, you may recall names such as Democritus and Mendeleev. Democritus was one of the first people to hypothesize that all matter is composed on tiny, individual particles (which we now call atoms), and Dmitiri Mendeleev is one of the fathers of our modern periodic table. Both of these men are considered foundational to our current understanding of chemistry, but they were far from alone in their efforts to explain and explore chemical phenomena.\n",

    "A lesser-known figure in the history of the science of chemistry was none other than a geologist, Alexandre-Émile Béguyer de Chancourtois. In the 1860s he published an early version of the periodic table that grouped elements according to their atomic weights. Rather than plotting the elements on a sheet of paper, he graphed them on a cylinder, and this three-dimensional representation allowed him to see clearly what was not obvious in two dimensions: that the elements exhibit physical properties in accordance with their atomic masses, and that there is periodicity (repetition at regular intervals) of these properties as atomic mass increases.

    ">The first (top) plot shows that electronegativity overall increases with atomic mass. We can assume that the lowest points in this chart are due to changing our \"NaN\" values to zeros, and can therefore ignore those as artifical lows. However, there are also places were electronegativity dips to a non-zero value as atomic mass increases. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Recall that electronegativity refers to an atom's ability to attract shared pairs of electrons to its outermost shell. As atomic mass increases, the number of protons within an atom's nucleus increases. More protons means that the atom is exerting a strong attractive force on nearby electrons, so as we travel across a period of the table, electronegativity increases. However, we expect a sudden decrease in electronegativty at the start of each new period. This is because the beginning of a new period signifies that we are filling a new electron shell, and each subsequent electron shell is further from the nucleus than the previous one. Due to the suddenly increased distance from the nucleus, elements on the far lefthand side of the table are slightly less able to attract electrons than than those elements which immediately preceed them, despite having more protons. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Similar to electronegativity, atomic radius increases with atomic mass, but also experiences dips in this trend. The reasoning for this is very similar to the reasoning for the electronegativity trend. As we read across the periodic table, elements are increasing in mass due mainly to an incrasing number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, but they are increasing in radius due to the filling of electron shells. Across a single period, atomic radius decreases because there are a larger number of protons available to attract a constant number of eletron shells. At the beginning of a new period, radius suddenly increases at electrons begin filling a new, more distant shell. "
