    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do some rivers carry large cobbles, and others only transport fine silt and clay? In your introductory geology classes, you've probably learned to classify fluvial environments in terms of their <i>energy.</i> For example, you might say that a braided stream is a 'high energy' environment, and a meandering river is 'low energy.' This isn't wrong, but it also isn't very quantitiative. How can we discriminate between 'high energy' and 'low energy' systems? Is a single river always 'high' or 'low' energy, or does the energy of a single river change throughout wet and dry seasons? In this lab, we'll learn how to quantitatively determine sediment transport, and we'll use some new programming tools to help us perform these calculations more efficiently. "

    "### Boundary shear stress\n",
    "\n",
    "When water flows across a stream bed, the water is exerting a <i>force</i> on that surface. Recalling that a stress is a force per unit area, we can also say that the water is exerting a <i>stress</i> on a given area of the stream bed. Stress is a vector quantity, meaning that it has directionality; any stress can be broken down into a normal stress, which acts perpendicular to a surface, and shear stress, which acts parallel to a surface. For problems concerning sediment transport in rivers, we're intersted in the component of stress that acts parallel to the riverbed, exactly at the water-sediment interface. This has a special name: <i><b>boundary shear stress</b></i>. Boundary shear stress, $\\tau_b$, is given by the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large{\\tau_b = \\rho g H \\sin(\\theta)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho$ is the fluid density ($kg/m^3$), $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity ($m/s^2$), $H$ is the depth of the flow ($m$), and $\\theta$ is the slope angle of the riverbed (degrees). From this equation, we can easily see that the boundary shear stress can be increased either by increasing the depth of a flow, or by increasing the channel gradient. Great! Is that all? \n",
    "\n",
    "Not quite. This equation alone can't tell us about the size of sediment that a river is capable of moving. To fully understand this, we need the meat and potatoes of sediment transport: the <b><i>critical shear stress</i></b>. But first, we'll quickly recap forces balances as a framework for understanding what exactly the critical shear stress represents."

    "### A balance of forces\n",
    "\n",
    "Many problems in physics start with an assumption that a system is at steady state, meaning there is no change happening through time, and these problems model that \"steady state\" through a force balance. An example of this would be a box sitting on an inclined ramp, but not sliding down the ramp. What's happening? In this example, a physicist would draw us a force balance diagram that shows that the down-ramp driving component of force ($mg\\sin\\theta$) is perfectly equal and opposite to the up-ramp opposing force of friction ($f$). Thus, the forces are balanced and no motion happens. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'data/force balance.png' align = 'right'> \n",
    "\n",
    "But wait! This can't be the case for sediment transport, because the whole point is that <i>motion</i> is occurring! Clearly, while sediment is being transported, the driving forces must outweigh the opposing forces. We won't get into exactly what the \"driving\" and \"opposing\" forces are during today's lab; instead, we'll focus on the moment of <i>transport initiation</i>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sediment transport will occur the moment boundary shear stress exceeds the critical shear stress by even the tiniest, most infintesimal amount. This means we can approximate the moment of transport initiation as the moment when boundary shear stress equals critical shear stress.\n",

These are called the Shields stress and critical Shields stress, respectively, and you're very likely to encounter them in the sediment transport literature.\n",

Here $\\tau_c^*$ is the dimensionless critical shear stress (critical Shields stress) which can be calculated from the following formulation from Andrews, 1983:\n",

Through grain size analysis, we could find a median grain size. This would tell us about a rough average of shear stress that the river is exerting on its bed. We could then plug this value into our boundary shear stress equation and, provided we had field data to measure the local gradient, back out an average flow depth for a given stream. Similarly, analyzing the largest grain sizes can tell us about the magnitude of flood events that a particular channel has seen."
